# CrossMgrLapCounter
Arduino library to access [CrossMgr](https://github.com/esitarski/CrossMgr)'s lapcounter websocket interface, currently for ESP8266

Derived from mature code we've been using to run an LED elapsed time clock at [BHPC](http://www.bhpc.org.uk/) races for a couple of years.

Still a work in progress.  ESP32 support and documentation to come.
